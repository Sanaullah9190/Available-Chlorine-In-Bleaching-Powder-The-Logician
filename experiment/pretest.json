        "a": "Explanation 1  <a href='www.google.com'>here</a>",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Sulfuric acid is used to acidify the solution. In an acidic medium, chlorine (from bleaching powder) reacts with potassium iodide to liberate iodine. The liberated iodine is then titrated with sodium thiosulphate.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1  <a href='www.google.com'>here</a>",
        "b": "Sodium thiosulphate reduces the liberated iodine (I₂) back to iodide (I⁻). It gets oxidized to tetrathionate in the process.",
