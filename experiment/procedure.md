1. Dissolve 1g bleaching powder in 1 litre of distilled water in a volumetric flask, and stopper the container.
(This can be done by first making a paste of the bleaching powder with mortar and pestle.)</br></br>
2. Place 5 mL acetic acid in an conical flask and add about 1g potassium iodide crystals. Pour 25 mL of bleaching powder solution prepared above and mix with a stirring rod.</br></br>
3. Titrate with 0.025 N sodium thiosulphate solution until a pale yellow colour is obtained. (Deep yellow changes to pale yellow.)</br></br>
4. Add 1mL of starch solution and titrate until the blue colour disappears.</br></br>
5. Note down the volume of sodium thiosulphate solution added V<sub>1</sub>.</br></br>
6. Take a volume of distilled water corresponding to the sample used.</br></br>
7. Add 5 mL acetic acid, 1g potassium iodide and 1 mL starch solution.</br></br>
8. If blue colour occurs, titrate with 0.025 N sodium thiosulphate solution until the blue colour disappears.</br></br>
9. Record the volume of sodium thiosulphate solution added V<sub>1</sub>.</br></br>
10. If no blue colour occurs, titrate with 0.025 N iodine solution until a blue colour appears. Note down the volume of iodine V<sub>2</sub>.</br></br>
11. Then, titrate with 0.025 N sodium thiosulphate solution till the blue colour disappears. Record the volume of sodium thiosulphate solution added A<sub>3</sub>. Note down the difference between the volume of iodine solution and sodium thiosulphate as A<sub>4</sub>(A<sub>4</sub>=A<sub>2</sub>- A<sub>3</sub>).
