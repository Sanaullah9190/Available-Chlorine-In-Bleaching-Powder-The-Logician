Bleaching powder (Ca(OCl)Cl or CaCl(OCl)) is widely used as a disinfectant and bleaching agent. The effectiveness of bleaching powder depends on the amount of available chlorine it can release. Available chlorine refers to the amount of chlorine that is liberated when bleaching powder reacts with dilute acids. This chlorine is responsible for the bleaching and disinfecting properties.

The available chlorine is usually determined using iodometric titration. In this method, chlorine released from bleaching powder reacts with potassium iodide (KI) in an acidic medium to liberate iodine (I₂). The liberated iodine is then titrated with sodium thiosulphate (Na₂S₂O₃) solution using starch as an indicator.

The amount of chlorine liberated by the action of dilute acids on hypochlorite is termed as “the available chlorine”. It is generally expressed as the percentage by weight of bleaching powder. In practice the available chlorine is determined by treating it with sodium thiosulphate solution in presence of acetic acid, the liberated chlorine is immediately treated with potassium iodide (KI) to give free iodine, which actually reacts with standard sodium thiosulphate solution, hence termed as Iodometric titration.  </br>
### Reactions
1. Ca(OCl)₂ + 2CH₃COOH → Ca(CH₃COO)₂ + Cl₂ + H₂O </br>
2. 2KI + Cl₂ → 2KCl + I₂ </br>
3. 2Na₂S₂O₃ + I₂ → 2NaI + Na₂S₄O₆</br>
*here*,</br>
Ca(OCl)₂ = 2Cl = Na₂S₄O₆</br>
Na₂S₄O₆(1 gm equivalent) = Cl(1 gm equivalent) = I(1 gm equivalent)</br>
### Method</br>
1. A known weight of bleaching powder is taken and made into a solution.


2. An aliquot of this solution is acidified (usually with acetic or sulfuric acid) and excess KI is added.


3. Liberated iodine gives a brown color.


4. The iodine is titrated with standard sodium thiosulphate solution until the solution becomes pale yellow.


5. A few drops of starch indicator are added (turns blue).


6. Titration is continued until the blue color disappears — this is the end point.
### Calculation</br>
**Given**:</br></br>
Normality of sodium thiosulphate solution = N/10 = 0.1 N

Volume of bleaching powder solution used = 25.0 mL

Average volume of sodium thiosulphate used = V mL 

Weight of bleaching powder taken for solution = 1.5 g 

Volume of the bleaching powder solution prepared = 250 mL
